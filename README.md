# Uturu OS

**A minimalist 16-bit x86 operating system from scratch**
## 🚀 Overview

Uturu OS is a completely from-scratch 16-bit operating system written entirely in x86 assembly language. Born from curiosity and passion for low-level programming, this project demonstrates how operating systems work at the most fundamental level.

> **Educational Focus**: Built for learning and experimentation with real-mode x86 architecture

## ✨ Features

### Core System
- 🖥️ **Custom Bootloader** - 512-byte master boot record
- ⚙️ **Monolithic Kernel** - Complete memory management and process control  
- ⌨️ **Interactive Shell** - Command-line interface with argument parsing
- 🛡️ **Safe Input Handling** - Protected against buffer overflow attacks

### System Utilities
- 🕐 **Real-time Clock** - Time display and configuration
- 💾 **Memory Management** - System memory detection and reporting
- 🎮 **Basic Graphics** - VGA mode demonstrations and games
- 🔧 **System Control** - Reboot and shutdown capabilities

### Fun Extras
- 🎯 **Minesweeper Game** - Classic puzzle game implementation
- 🔍 **Easter Eggs** - Hidden features waiting to be discovered!
- 📟 **Retro Aesthetic** - Authentic 16-bit computing experience

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### Boot Process
1. **BIOS** loads 512-byte bootloader at 0x7C00
2. **Bootloader** loads kernel from disk sectors 2-41
3. **Kernel** initializes at 0x7E00 with system setup
4. **Shell** starts interactive command processing

### Memory Layout
- `0x0000-0x7BFF` - BIOS and system data
- `0x7C00-0x7DFF` - Bootloader (512 bytes)
- `0x7E00-0xFFFF` - Kernel and system memory

### Key Features
- **Real-mode operation** - Direct hardware access
- **Protected input** - Bounds-checked string handling  
- **Modular commands** - Easy to extend functionality
- **BIOS integration** - Leverages firmware services

## 🐛 Current Status: Beta 6

**What works:**
- ✅ Stable boot process
- ✅ Complete shell environment  
- ✅ Basic system utilities
- ✅ Memory detection
- ✅ Real-time clock
- ✅ Graphics demonstrations

**Known limitations:**
